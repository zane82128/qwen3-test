  \"QUESTIONS\": [
    {
      \"Q\": \"What specific form types—such as wave-like motion or layered curves—are most prevalent in wind patterns and clouds in motion during moments of high emotional intensity (e.g., joy or melancholy), and how do these forms differ from neutral or calm conditions?\",
      \"DIMENSION\": \"FORM\",
      \"WHY\": \"Form variation during emotional states reveals how Fauvism’s expressive dynamics translate into atmospheric motion and narrative tension.\",
      \"PRIORITY\": 1,
      \"ANSWER_FORMAT\": \"ranked list of 3 form types (e.g., 'layered curves', 'wave-like motion', 'dynamic spirals') with description of emotional state differences\",

    {
      \"Q\": \"In cloud scenes, how does the saturation of red-yellow and blue-orange pairs shift during a transition from calm dawn to melancholic twilight, and what specific brushwork thickness (e.g., thick, medium) is used to maintain visual consistency with the emotional tone?\",
      \"DIMENSION\": \"COLOR_TONALITY\",
      \"WHY\": \"Color saturation and brushwork must align across time-based transitions to ensure emotional continuity and stylistic coherence.\",
      \"PRIORITY\": 2,

      \"DIMENSION\": \"COMPOSITION_ROLE\",
      \"WHY\": \"Composition role determines narrative function, and its variation clarifies how atmospheric elements drive emotional or environmental storytelling.\",
