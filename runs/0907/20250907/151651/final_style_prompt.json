A vibrant, expressive painting with high-saturation (70–100%) non-naturalistic colors, dynamic biomorphic forms occupying 60–80% of the composition, fluid brushwork with 0.5–2mm impasto on edges and highlights, swirling strokes on dragon wings, and soft gradients (0–30%) in floating island scenes—balanced by grounded elements (20–40%) like children (1:3–1:5 scale) or festival groups (3:1 human-to-nature ratio), evoking whimsical, emotionally resonant narratives of nature, childhood, and seasonal harmony.
