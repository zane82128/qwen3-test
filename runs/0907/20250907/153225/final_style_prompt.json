STYLE: Organic, fluid forms with 40–50% negative space, high-saturation (100–130%) vivid color pairs like magenta and teal or lime and violet, wet-on-wet layering with horizontal, diagonal, and swirling strokes, soft impasto (0.8–1.5mm) for emotional warmth, and a narrative progression from intimate child expression to environmental harmony via a rainbow bridge.
