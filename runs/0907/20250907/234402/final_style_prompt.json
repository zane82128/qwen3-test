STYLE: A misty bridge with a fox 10–30% off-center, rendered in delicate ink washes with 20–40% water and 30–60% opacity, using soft pastel tones #F5F0E6, #D1C4E9, #E6D9F0, #F0E6D1, #D9E6F5, under diffused lighting where lantern glow softly blends into the mist and illuminates the fox without sharp highlights, creating a serene, asymmetrical atmosphere with rhythmic horizontal and vertical flow.
