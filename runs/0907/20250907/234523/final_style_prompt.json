STYLE: Swirling organic forms with flowing leading lines from bicycle to windmill and flowing negative space between windmill and stars, rendered in 2–4 mm impasto strokes with 60% warm and 40% cool tonal balance (windmill:50/50, bicycle:60/40, stars:40/60), soft gradients, and a serene, luminous atmosphere blending Van Gogh’s expressive energy with Studio Ghibli’s dreamlike calm.
