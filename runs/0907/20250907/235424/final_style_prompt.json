STYLE: A loose, asymmetrical composition with a 30°–45° diagonal horizon and 50%–70% negative space for mist and floating elements, rendered in tan, gray, soft green, and pale blue tones with 10%–25% saturation and a cool-to-warm transition from left to right, using soft feathered brushstrokes of 0.5mm–1.0mm thickness and no sharp outlines or patterned textures, evoking a nostalgic, serene atmosphere of fleeting beauty and transience.
