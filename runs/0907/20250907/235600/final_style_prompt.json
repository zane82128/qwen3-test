STYLE: Swirling, impasto forms with thick buildup and dry brushing on a central windmill, featuring warm ochres (40–50%) and cobalt blues (50–60%) in layered, dynamic composition; stars positioned above and diagonally with radial glow and 10–30% luminance gradient, creating soft transitions and emotional counterpoint to the windmill’s slow, wobbling rotation.
