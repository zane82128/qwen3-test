    "ROUND": 1,
    "ASK_STYLE": "Fauvism blended with Miyazaki’s whimsical, expressive style—bold, vibrant colors, soft organic lines, and dreamlike atmosphere.",
    "STYLE_RESPONSE": "{
  \"STYLE_BRIEF\": {
    \"FORM_COMPOSITION\": \"Loose, organic forms with flowing, curvilinear shapes; asymmetrical layouts emphasizing dynamic movement and emotional resonance; minimal structural rigidity, favoring intuitive, childlike spatial arrangements.\",
    \"COLOR_TONALITY\": \"Highly saturated, non-naturalistic palette featuring bold primary and secondary hues (e.g., electric blue, magenta, lime green, burnt orange); strong contrast between complementary colors; warm and cool tones used expressively to evoke mood rather than realism.\",
    \"BRUSHWORK_TECHNIQUE\": \"Expressive, gestural strokes with soft, blended transitions; gentle layering of paint to create soft textures; emphasis on fluidity and emotional impact over precision or detail.\",
    \"EXPRESSION_THEME\": \"Dreamlike, fantastical environments; gentle whimsy with a sense of wonder; emotional intimacy and harmony between nature and imagination; focus on joy, simplicity, and inner peace.\",
    \"HISTORICAL_CONTEXT\": \"Rooted in early 20th-century Fauvism (Matisse, Derain) for color intensity and emotional expression, fused with Studio Ghibli’s Miyazaki aesthetic (post-1980s Japanese animation) for narrative warmth and organic form.\"
  },
  \"MERGE_STRATEGY\": \"Prioritize expressive color use from Fauvism and organic, flowing forms from Miyazaki’s animation style; resolve tension by balancing boldness with softness—using Fauvism’s chromatic intensity within Miyazaki’s gentle, flowing compositions to maintain emotional coherence and visual harmony.\",
  \"EVALUATION_CRITERIA\": [
    \"Presence of at least three bold, non-naturalistic colors in high saturation\",
    \"Use of soft, organic lines and flowing forms without sharp geometric structure\",
    \"Dreamlike atmosphere with emotional warmth and whimsy\",
    \"No literal realism in form or color; all elements serve expressive purpose\"
