    "STYLE_RESPONSE": "{
  \"STYLE_BRIEF\": {
    \"FORM_COMPOSITION\": \"Loose, organic shapes with fluid, non-logical spatial arrangements; whimsical, childlike figures and environments; dynamic yet surreal compositions emphasizing emotional resonance over realism.\",
    \"COLOR_TONALITY\": \"High-saturation, primary-dominated palette (red, yellow, blue, orange) with unexpected complementary clashes; soft glows and pastel accents in background layers; vibrant but harmonious color fields avoiding harsh contrasts.\",
