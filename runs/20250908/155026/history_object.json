      \"Q\": \"What specific color palette is commonly used in the depicted objects (e.g., dominant hues, undertones) in this style of painting?\",
      \"DIMENSION\": \"COLOR_PALETTE\",
      \"WHY\": \"Color palette defines visual identity and distinguishes the style from others\",
      \"PRIORITY\": 1,
      \"ANSWER_FORMAT\": \"list of 3-5 primary colors with undertones (e.g., 'cadmium red, burnt sienna, cool gray')\",

      \"WHY\": \"Material and texture influence realism and tactile perception in object representation\",
