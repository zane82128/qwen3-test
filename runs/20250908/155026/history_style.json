  \"STYLE_BRIEF\": {
    \"FORM_COMPOSITION\": \"Asymmetrical balance with dynamic diagonals, fragmented forms, and overlapping planes creating visual tension; structured yet loose spatial organization.\",
    \"COLOR_TONALITY\": \"Earth tones with muted ochres, deep umbers, and soft greens; low saturation, cool-to-neutral bias with occasional sharp accents of crimson or cobalt.\",
    \"BRUSHWORK_TECHNIQUE\": \"Loose, gestural strokes with visible impasto texture; layered glazes and broken brushmarks to convey movement and emotional intensity.\",
    \"EXPRESSION_THEME\": \"Inner turmoil, isolation, and existential reflection; themes of urban decay, fragmented identity, and quiet desperation.\",
    \"HISTORICAL_CONTEXT\": \"Post-World War II European expressionism, influenced by German expressionism and early abstract expressionism, with echoes of contemporary minimalism.\"
