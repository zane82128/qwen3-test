    "ASK_STYLE": "Fauvism blended with Miyazaki’s whimsical, expressive style—bold, vibrant colors, fluid lines, and dreamlike fantasy atmosphere.",
    "STYLE_RESPONSE": "{
  \"STYLE_BRIEF\": {
    \"FORM_COMPOSITION\": \"Loose, organic forms with dynamic, flowing lines; non-figurative or stylized figures in surreal, dreamlike arrangements; emphasis on emotional expression over realism.\",
    \"COLOR_TONALITY\": \"Highly saturated, bold primary and secondary colors (e.g., cadmium red, cobalt blue, lemon yellow); exaggerated color contrasts; vibrant yet harmonious palettes with no naturalistic gradients.\",
    \"BRUSHWORK_TECHNIQUE\": \"Expressive, gestural brushstrokes with visible texture; fluid, sweeping motions; layered application to build color intensity and depth; minimal detail in form.\",
    \"EXPRESSION_THEME\": \"Whimsical fantasy; playful, childlike imagination; emotional resonance through color and form; magical, idyllic environments with soft, floating elements.\",
    \"HISTORICAL_CONTEXT\": \"Early 20th century Fauvism (Matisse, Vlaminck) fused with contemporary Japanese animation aesthetics (Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films), emphasizing emotional storytelling and visual poetry.\"
  },

    \"Presence of at least three bold, non-naturalistic color blocks in a single composition\",
